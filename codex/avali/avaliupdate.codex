    "Excerpt from personal log of Nezi, one of the workers in charge of unloading updates.",

    "They said the update would be arriving soon. We watched the landing zone for hours, but nothing showed up. After a few hours, we began to worry. Did the update lose its way? Was there an accident? We had no way of knowing. All we could do was watch, wait, and pray that it would come soon. Then, on the morning of the fourth day after it should have arrived, it appeared on the horizon.",

    "Then another appeared. And another. They kept coming into view, one after another, until they darkened the sky. There were so many of them. As they approached, they began to collide with one another, fighting for who would reach the landing zone first. The struggle in the skies was violent, with update crashing into update, their mutual destruction assured.",

    "Many were injured in the rain of twisted metal and flaming wreckage. Those among us who sought shelter quickly got away relatively unscathed. Others had been injured, with wounds ranging from light scratches to broken limbs.",

    "The bound humans, who we were keeping next to the landing zone in a crudely constructed cardboard shelter, as we had no idea what to do with them, well... Their fate is, for the moment, unknown. I thought I saw someone running towards the box, but I never saw what happened. The wreckage started crashing down, fiery and thick in that moment.",

    "After that, I hid in the nearest tent with my pack, and so many others, the nanocanvas structure protecting us all as the able bodied among us went about tending to the wounded. After what felt like ages,  when the cacophony stopped, we peeked outside. The ground had been baptized in burning wreckage, and the landing zone was all but buried.",

    "The cardboard shelter containing the humans was nowhere to be seen. A lone, surviving update had weathered the storm, and was sitting perched atop a mountain of it's fallen brethren. We stepped out of our hiding places, slowly picking our way across the fields of smoldering steel, to see what the update had brought for us this time.",
    
    "It was, disappointingly, not a lot. A few chips to install in our nanolooms, enabling them to make normal cloth and a few bits of clothing that didn't fit very well, and some rifles that, if anything, seemed worse than the ones we already had. It was hardly worth all the work it would take to clean this mess up."
