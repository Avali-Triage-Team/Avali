# Avali
Avali mod with community additions

This Unstable fork will try to keep up to date with the Unstable version of Starbound. Be aware that this may lag quite a bit behind UNstable, and much like Unstable may be, well, unstable. Please report issues promptly, using the Issues button to the right of the files. 

# Installation instructions
Download ZIP file and extract into Starbound - Unstable/giraffe_storage/mods. Files should look like this: 
mods
-avali
|-avali.modinfo

Always remember to delete the previous verison before installing any new one!

# Making a feature suggestion
If you have the know-how to code everything yourself, feel free to make a Fork, make your changes, then make a Pull Request. Chances are I'll take a glance over what you added then just plop it in.
Please test your additions before you make the pull request.
